**An Architectural Style for IoT Systems**


An IoT architectural style can be used as a starting point for a coherent modeling of IoT systems, guiding the architect on the way IoT components should be combined.

This IoT style is compatible with the IoT conceptual model defined by the ISO/IEC 30141 Standard, which provides the common structure and definitions for describing the entities of IoT systems and the relationships among them.

The IoT style was specified through a set of constraints that characterize the style, in addition to the structural and behavioral views of the architectural elements of the style, defined in the  [SysADL language](http://sysadl.org).

SysADL has tooling support that allowed the validation of the style implementation via the definition of a real IoT system, SmartPlace, that was specified, implemented, and is running on several buildings of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, controlling air conditioning and saving energy.
