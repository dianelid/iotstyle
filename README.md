**IoT Style**

An architectural style can be used as a starting point for a coherent modeling of systems, guiding the architect on the way IoT components should be combined.

The IoT style is an architectural style for IoT Systems compatible with the ISO/IEC 30141 Standard, which provides the common structure and definitions for describing the entities of IoT systems and the relationships among them.

The IoT style was specified through a set of constraints that characterize the style, in addition to the structural and behavioral views of the architectural elements of the style, defined in the  [SysADL language](http://sysadl.org).

SysADL has tooling support provided by SysADL Studio, which allows the use and validation of the implementation of the IoT style, so that if any constraint of the style is violated the architect is communicated.
